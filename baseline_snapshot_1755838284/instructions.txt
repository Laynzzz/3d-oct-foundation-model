BASELINE SNAPSHOT INSTRUCTIONS
=============================
Timestamp: 1755838284
Directory: baseline_snapshot_1755838284

CURRENT STATUS:
- Training running at step 1113+ 
- A-prime fix successful (no NaN at step 514)
- Ready to capture baseline

NEXT ACTIONS (do these when convenient):

1. WAIT for next automatic checkpoint save
   - Training saves every 5 epochs or at completion
   - Check /tmp/checkpoints/ on TPU for new checkpoint
   - OR check GCS: gs://layne-tpu-code-sync/checkpoints/vjepa2/

2. CAPTURE W&B metrics over last ~200 steps:
   - Go to W&B dashboard 
   - Export train/lr, train/grad_norm, train/loss
   - Should show: lr=1e-4 (flat), grad_norm>0 (finite), loss trending

3. DOCUMENT throughput baseline:
   - Current: per_core_batch_size=1, grad_accum_steps=4
   - Global batch = 1 * 16_cores * 4_accum = 64
   - Record samples/sec/core from recent logs

4. THEN proceed to Step 2: Verify XLA-friendly metrics

CRITICAL: Do NOT stop training to create snapshot!
The training is stable and we can work around it.
